    <p>
      I am a student at Perry Meridian High School. 
      I am an upcoming senior and I want to travel the world one day.
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, such as Minecraft.
      <br>
      I also like to hangout with friends whenever I have the chance and love eating food.
      I aspire to become an engineer in the future. However, I am unaware what type.
      I hope Nextech can enlighten me on what I want to do in the future.
